        Gift cards can be purchased and redeemed for car rentals or other services offered by our platform. Gift cards are non-refundable, and no change will be given for unused amounts. Expired or unused balances on gift cards will not be refunded, so we encourage customers to use their gift cards promptly. Terms and conditions may vary by location.
